				<h3 class="text-vyoma-blue">Who We Are</h3>
				<p class="mx-2">
					We are the aero-design team of RV College of Engineering.
					Started in 2007, we are one of the leading student projects
					in India, having won many national and international
					competitions and awards such as the NASA Systems Engineering
					Award.
				</p>
				<h3 class="text-vyoma-blue">What We Do</h3>
				<p class="mx-2">
					Carry out cutting edge research for development of Unmanned
					Aerial Vehicles. Ignite inquisitiveness and interest in
					young minds in Aerospace Engineering and help them along
					that path. Represent our country in numerous International
					competitions like SAE Aero-design, AIAA Design Build Fly &
					IMAV.
				</p>
				<h3 class="text-vyoma-blue">Our Mission</h3>
				<p class="mx-2">
					To develop state of the art technologies in the field
					Autonomous Robotics, to accelerate the growth of the
					Aerospace domain by conceiving a Societal Drone Era, to
					Carry out R&D in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, to perform custom
					advanced missions for societal use.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-vyoma-blue">History</h3>

				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					Project Vyoma was founded in 2007 by a group of seven students.
					Our big breakthrough occured when we took part in an
					international aerodesign competition in the USA, organized
					by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Our first
					project, Vyoma-I, was a success, and we ranked 18th out of
					40 teams that participated in the event.

				</div>
				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					Vyoma-II was our next project for the 2009 SAE Aero Design
					competition. We went on to secure the 20th position out of
					43 teams that participated. We also showcased our aircraft
					at the 2011 Times Auto Expo at Palace Grounds, Bangalore.

				</div>
				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					In 2011, our next project Vyoma-III ranked 8th out of 17
					teams in the SAE Aero Design competition. We were also
					awarded a certificate of appreciation for being the first
					and only team to represent India at the event by none other
					than then President of India, Smt. Pratibha Devsingh Patil.
					We showcased our aircraft at the 2009 and 2010 IIT-Madras
					Shaastra fests too.
				</p>
				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					In 2013, we won the NASA Systems Engineering Award at the
					SAE Aero Design West competition - the best among 75 teams
					from around the world. We received a $750 cash prize as well
					as a trophy from NASA. Our UAV was also featured as one of
					the top 24 innovations in the country by ET Now.
				</p>
				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					In 2015, Project Vyoma participated in the 2015
					Design/Build/Fly (DBF) event at Tucson, Arizon. We were
					officially the first Indian team to take off at an AIAA DBF
					event. Our entry was featured by some of the top newspapers
					in the country. The year concluded with us securing 4th
					place among 26 teams at the Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle
					Competition at Niwot, Colorado. We presented
					V.E.N.G.E.A.N.C.E., capable of object detection and
					avoidance and autonomous navigation (without using GPS!). We
					were once again the only Indian team selected for the event.
				</p>
				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					In 2018, we participated in the 2018 Design/Build/Fly (DBF)
					competition, requiring us to design a dual-purpose regional
					and business aircraft. Our design report was graded 10th
					globally.

					<span class="text-white">Our 2018 DBF aircraft</span>
				</div>
				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					In 2019, we participated in the 2019 DBF competition, where
					our design proposal placed 13th out of 140 international
					teams. This year the competition was more challenging as it
					required us to build a multi-purpose aircraft that simulates
					carrier operations.
				</p>
				<p class="leading-8 text-left mx-2">
					Over the coming years, we have continued to participate in
					these competitions. We participated in DBF 2020 and 2021,
					even though the events were held virtually due to the
					COVID-19 pandemic. That brings us to the present day. We
					would not have been able to achieve all this without the
					support of our college, our sponsors, and our crowd-funding
					campaigns.
